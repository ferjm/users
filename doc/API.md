# User Management API

This document provides protocol-level details of the User Management API.

___

# HTTP API

This library exposes an HTTP API to register a single user and obtain session tokens for that user.

In the future, the API will evolve to support multiple users.

## URL Structure

All requests will be to URLs of the form:

    https://<host-url>/v1/<api-endpoint>

Note that:

* All API access must be over a properly-validated HTTPS connection.
* The URL embeds a version identifier "v1"; future revisions of this API may introduce new version numbers.
* The API endpoints may be mounted on a path different than the host root. For instance, for [Project Link](https://github.com/fxbox/foxbox) we are mounting this API at `/users`, so the URLs end up being `https://<host-url>/users/v1/<api-endpoint>`.

## Request Format

All POST requests must have a content-type of `application/json` with a utf8-encoded JSON body.

### Authentication

For the first iteration of this project, requests that require user authentication must contain a header including a signed [JWT](https://jwt.io/). We may want to use [HAWK](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk) in the future.

Use the JWT with this header:

```js
{
    "Authorization": "Bearer <jwt>"
}
```

For example:

```curl
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/services' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJraWQiOm51bGwsImFsZyI6IkhTMjU2In0.eyJpZCI6MiwibmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIn0.JNtvokupDl2hdqB+vER15y89qigPc4FviZfJOSR1Vso'
```

## Response Format

All successful requests will produce a response with HTTP status code of "20X" and content-type of "application/json".  The structure of the response body will depend on the endpoint in question.

Failures due to invalid behavior from the client will produce a response with HTTP status code in the "4XX" range and content-type of "application/json".  Failures due to an unexpected situation on the server side will produce a response with HTTP status code in the "5XX" range and content-type of "application/json".

To simplify error handling for the client, the type of error is indicated both by a particular HTTP status code, and by an application-specific error code in the JSON response body.  For example:

```js
{
  "code": 400, // matches the HTTP status code
  "errno": 777, // stable application-level error number
  "error": "Bad Request", // string description of the error type
  "message": "the value of salt is not allowed to be undefined"
}
```

Responses for particular types of error may include additional parameters.

The currently-defined error responses are:
* status code 400, errno 400: Bad request.
* status code 400, errno 100: Invalid name. Missing or malformed name.
* status code 400, errno 101: Invalid email. Missing or malformed email.
* status code 400, errno 102: Invalid password. The password should have a minimum of 8 chars.
* status code 400, errno 103: Missing or malformed authentication header.
* status code 400, errno 104: Invalid user id.
* status code 401, errno 401: Unauthorized. If credentials are not valid.
* status code 409, errno 409: Conflict. The user is already registered.
* status code 410, errno 410: Gone. The resource is no more available. Don't insist.
* status code 423, errno 423: Locked. You are trying to delete yourself or the last user with admin privileges. That's forbidden.
* status code 501, errno 501: Internal server error.
* any status code, errno 999: Unknown error
